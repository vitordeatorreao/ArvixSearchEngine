    "paper_abstract": "In this paper, we study the task of detecting semantic parts of an object.\nThis is very important in computer vision, as it provides the possibility to\nparse an object as human do, and helps us better understand object detection\nalgorithms. Also, detecting semantic parts is very challenging especially when\nthe parts are partially or fully occluded. In this scenario, the popular\nproposal-based methods like Faster-RCNN often produce unsatisfactory results,\nbecause both the proposal extraction and classification stages may be confused\nby the irrelevant occluders.\n<br />To this end, we propose a novel detection framework, named DeepVoting, which\naccumulates local visual cues, called visual concepts (VC), to locate the\nsemantic parts. Our approach involves adding two layers after the intermediate\noutputs of a deep neural network. The first layer is used to extract VC\nresponses, and the second layer performs a voting mechanism to capture the\nspatial relationship between VC's and semantic parts. The benefit is that each\nsemantic part is supported by multiple VC's. Even if some of the supporting\nVC's are missing due to occlusion, we can still infer the presence of the\ntarget semantic part using the remaining ones. To avoid generating an\nexponentially large training set to cover all occlusion cases, we train our\nmodel without seeing occlusion and transfer the learned knowledge to deal with\nocclusions. This setting favors learning the models which are naturally robust\nand adaptive to occlusions instead of over-fitting the occlusion patterns in\nthe training data. In experiments, DeepVoting shows significantly better\nperformance on semantic part detection in occlusion scenarios, compared with\nFaster-RCNN, with one order of magnitude fewer parameters and 2.5x testing\nspeed. In addition, DeepVoting is explainable as the detection result can be\ndiagnosed via looking up the voted VC's.",
