    "paper_abstract": "In this paper, we present a simple analysis of {\\bf fast rates} with {\\it\nhigh probability} of {\\bf empirical minimization} for {\\it stochastic composite\noptimization} over a finite-dimensional bounded convex set with exponential\nconcave loss functions and an arbitrary convex regularization. To the best of\nour knowledge, this result is the first of its kind. As a byproduct, we can\ndirectly obtain the fast rate with {\\it high probability} for exponential\nconcave empirical risk minimization with and without any convex regularization,\nwhich not only extends existing results of empirical risk minimization but also\nprovides a unified framework for analyzing exponential concave empirical risk\nminimization with and without {\\it any} convex regularization. Our proof is\nvery simple only exploiting the covering number of a finite-dimensional bounded\nset and a concentration inequality of random vectors.",
