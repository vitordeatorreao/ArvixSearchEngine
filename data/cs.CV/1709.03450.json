    "paper_abstract": "For complex segmentation tasks, fully automatic systems are inherently\nlimited in their achievable accuracy for extracting relevant objects.\nEspecially in cases where only few data sets need to be processed for a highly\naccurate result, semi-automatic segmentation techniques exhibit a clear benefit\nfor the user. One area of application is medical image processing during an\nintervention for a single patient. We propose a learning-based cooperative\nsegmentation approach which includes the computing entity as well as the user\ninto the task. Our system builds upon a state-of-the-art fully convolutional\nartificial neural network (FCN) as well as an active user model for training.\nDuring the segmentation process, a user of the trained system can iteratively\nadd additional hints in form of pictorial scribbles as seed points into the FCN\nsystem to achieve an interactive and precise segmentation result. The\nsegmentation quality of interactive FCNs is evaluated. Iterative FCN approaches\ncan yield superior results compared to networks without the user input channel\ncomponent, due to a consistent improvement in segmentation quality after each\ninteraction.",
