    "paper_abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the latent structure of a social\nnetwork based on observational data on information diffusion processes, or {\\it\ncascades}. Here for a given cascade, we only observe the time a node/agent is\ninfected but not the source of infection. Existing literature has focused on\nestimating network diffusion matrix without any underlying assumptions on the\nstructure of the network. We propose a novel model for inferring network\ndiffusion matrix based on the intuition that an information datum is more\nlikely to propagate among two nodes if they are interested in similar topics,\nwhich are common with the information. In particular, our model endows each\nnode with an influence vector (how authoritative they are on each topic) and a\nreceptivity vector (how susceptible they are on each topic). We show how this\nnode-topic structure can be estimated from observed cascades. The estimated\nmodel can be used to build recommendation system based on the receptivity\nvectors, as well as for marketing based on the influence vectors.",
