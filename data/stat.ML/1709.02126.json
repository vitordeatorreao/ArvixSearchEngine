The workshop aim is to bring together researchers from the\nformal verification community that are developing formal methods for autonomous\nvehicles as well as researchers working, e.g., in the area of control theory or\nrobotics, interested in applying verification techniques for designing and\ndeveloping of autonomous vehicles.",
