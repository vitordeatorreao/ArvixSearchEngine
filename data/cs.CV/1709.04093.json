    "paper_abstract": "We present a novel approach for learning to predict sets using deep learning.\nIn recent years, deep neural networks have shown remarkable results in computer\nvision, natural language processing and other related problems. Despite their\nsuccess, traditional architectures suffer from a serious limitation in that\nthey are built to deal with structured input and output data, i.e. vectors or\nmatrices. Many real-world problems, however, are naturally described as sets,\nrather than vectors. Existing techniques that allow for sequential data, such\nas recurrent neural networks, typically heavily depend on the input and output\norder and do not guarantee a valid solution. Here, we derive in a principled\nway, a mathematical formulation for set prediction which is permutation\ninvariant. In particular, our approach jointly learns both the cardinality and\nthe state distribution of the target set. We demonstrate the validity of our\nmethod on the task of multi-label image classification and achieve a new state\nof the art on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.",
