    "paper_abstract": "Much combinatorial optimisation problems constitute a non-polynomial (NP)\nhard optimisation problem, i.e., they can not be solved in polynomial time. One\nsuch problem is finding the shortest route between two nodes on a graph.\nMeta-heuristic algorithms such as $A^{*}$ along with mixed-integer programming\n(MIP) methods are often employed for these problems. Our work demonstrates that\nit is possible to approximate solutions generated by a meta-heuristic algorithm\nusing a deep recurrent neural network. We compare different methodologies based\non reinforcement learning (RL) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to gauge\ntheir respective quality of approximation. We show the viability of recurrent\nneural network solutions on a graph that has over 300 nodes and argue that a\nsequence-to-sequence network rather than other recurrent networks has improved\napproximation quality. Additionally, we argue that homotopy continuation --\nthat increases chances of hitting an extremum -- further improves the estimate\ngenerated by a vanilla RNN.",
