    "paper_abstract": "In this paper we introduce a natural image prior that directly represents a\nGaussian-smoothed version of the natural image distribution. We include our\nprior in a formulation of image restoration as a Bayes estimator that also\nallows us to solve noise-blind image restoration problems. We show that the\ngradient of our prior corresponds to the mean-shift vector on the natural image\ndistribution. In addition, we learn the mean-shift vector field using denoising\nautoencoders, and use it in a gradient descent approach to perform Bayes risk\nminimization. We demonstrate competitive results for noise-blind deblurring,\nsuper-resolution, and demosaicing.",
