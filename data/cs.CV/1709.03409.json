    "paper_abstract": "We cast the sketch-based retrieval as edge-map matching. A shared\nconvolutional network is trained to extract descriptors from edge maps and\nsketches, which are treated as a special case of edge maps. The network is\nfine-tuned solely from edge maps of landmark images. The training images are\nacquired in a fully unsupervised manner from 3D landmark models obtained by an\nautomated structure-from-motion pipeline.\n<br />The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on a standard\nbenchmark. On two other fine-grained sketch-based retrieval benchmarks, it\nperforms on par with or comes just after the method specifically designed for\nthe dataset.",
