Specifically, we train a network that, given a small set of\nannotated images, produces parameters for a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).\nWe use this FCN to perform dense pixel-level prediction on a test image for the\nnew semantic class. Our architecture shows a 25% relative meanIoU improvement\ncompared to the best baseline methods for one-shot segmentation on unseen\nclasses in the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and is at least 3 times faster.",
