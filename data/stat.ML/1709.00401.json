    "paper_abstract": "We present an inverse probability weighted estimator for survival analysis\nunder informative right censoring. Our estimator has the novel property that it\nconverges to a normal variable at $n^{1/2}$ rate for a large class of censoring\nprobability estimators, including many data-adaptive (e.g., machine learning)\nprediction methods. We present the formula of the asymptotic variance of the\nestimator, which allows the computation of asymptotically correct confidence\nintervals and p-values under data-adaptive estimation of the censoring and\ntreatment probabilities. We demonstrate the asymptotic properties of the\nestimator in simulation studies, and illustrate its use in a phase III clinical\ntrial for estimating the effect of a novel therapy for the treatment of breast\ncancer.",
