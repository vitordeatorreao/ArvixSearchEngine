    "paper_abstract": "Vulnerability of state-of-the-art deep neural networks to adversarial attacks\nhas been attracting a lot of attention recently. In this work we propose a new\nalgorithm for constructing universal adversarial perturbations. Our approach is\nbased on computing the so called $(p, q)$-singular vectors of the Jacobian\nmatrices of hidden layers of a network. Resulting perturbations present\ninteresting visual patterns and by using a batch of just $64$ images we can\nconstruct adversarial perturbations with relatively high fooling rate. We also\ninvestigate a correlation between the singular values of the Jacobian matrices\nand the fooling rate of a corresponding singular vector.",
