    "paper_abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of disentanglement of factors that\ngenerate a given data into those that are correlated with the labeling and\nthose that are not. Our solution is simpler than previous solutions and employs\nadversarial training in a straightforward manner. We demonstrate the new method\non visual datasets as well as on financial data. In order to evaluate the\nlatter, we developed a hypothetical trading strategy whose performance is\naffected by the performance of the disentanglement, namely, it trades better\nwhen the factors are better separated.",
