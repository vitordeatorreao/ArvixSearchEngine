    "paper_abstract": "In this letter, we propose a new identification criterion that guarantees the\nrecovery of the low-rank latent factors in the nonnegative matrix factorization\n(NMF) model, under mild conditions. Specifically, using the proposed criterion,\nit suffices to identify the latent factors if the rows of one factor are\n\\emph{sufficiently scattered} over the nonnegative orthant, while no structural\nassumption is imposed on the other factor except being full-rank. This is by\nfar the mildest condition under which the latent factors are provably\nidentifiable from the NMF model.",
