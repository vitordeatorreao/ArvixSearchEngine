    "paper_abstract": "In this paper we present a method for the unsupervised clustering of\nhigh-dimensional binary data, with a special focus on electronic healthcare\nrecords. We present a robust and efficient heuristic to face this problem using\ntensor decomposition. We present the reasons why this approach is preferable\nfor tasks such as clustering patient records, to more commonly used\ndistance-based methods. We run the algorithm on two datasets of healthcare\nrecords, obtaining clinically meaningful results.",
