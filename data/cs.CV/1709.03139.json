    "paper_abstract": "Grid maps are widely used in robotics to represent obstacles in the\nenvironment and differentiating dynamic objects from static infrastructure is\nessential for many practical applications. In this work, we present a methods\nthat uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer whether grid cells\nare covering a moving object or not. Compared to tracking approaches, that use\ne.g. a particle filter to estimate grid cell velocities and then make a\ndecision for individual grid cells based on this estimate, our approach uses\nthe entire grid map as input image for a CNN that inspects a larger area around\neach cell and thus takes the structural appearance in the grid map into account\nto make a decision. Compared to our reference method, our concept yields a\nperformance increase from 83.9% to 97.2%. A runtime optimized version of our\napproach yields similar improvements with an execution time of just 10\nmilliseconds.",
