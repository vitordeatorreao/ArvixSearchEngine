    "paper_abstract": "This paper presents a deep learning method for faster magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) by reducing k-space data with sub-Nyquist sampling strategies and\nprovides a rationale for why the proposed approach works well. Uniform\nsubsampling is used in the time-consuming phase-encoding direction to capture\nhigh-resolution image information, while permitting the image-folding problem\ndictated by the Poisson summation formula. To deal with the localization\nuncertainty due to image folding, very few low-frequency k-space data are\nadded. Training the deep learning net involves input and output images that are\npairs of Fourier transforms of the subsampled and fully sampled k-space data.\nNumerous experiments show the remarkable performance of the proposed method;\nonly 29% of k-space data can generate images of high quality as effectively as\nstandard MRI reconstruction with fully sampled data.",
