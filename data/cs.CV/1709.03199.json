    "paper_abstract": "In the isointense stage, the accurate volumetric image segmentation is a\nchallenging task due to the low contrast between tissues. In this paper, we\npropose a novel very deep network architecture based on densely convolution\nnetwork for volumetric brain segmentation. The proposed network architecture\nprovides a dense connection between layers that aims to improve the information\nflow in the network. By concatenating features map of fine and coarse dense\nblocks, it allows capturing multi-scale contextual information. Experimental\nresults demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed method over existing\nmethods, in terms of both segmentation accuracy and parameter efficiency in\nMICCAI grand challenge on 6-month infant brain MRI segmentation.",
